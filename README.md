# Encore III based Mouse Twitcher

I was in need of a mouse twitcher, but could not wait for a few days. The fundamental idea is to have a USB device that prevents the computer screen saver from activating as there's constant mouse activity.

enCoRe III Full-Speed USB Controller (CY7C64215) from Cypress Semiconductor acts as a two-axis USB mouse. The cursor is automatically moved back and forth every five seconds.

No real magic here.

Design tool used PSoC Designer 5.4 sp1.

## Physical prototype

Ad hoc to the max. PCB made with dremel.
